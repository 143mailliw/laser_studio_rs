# Introduction
Welcome to Laser Studio! Laser Studio's documentation includes both a reference for the expression language, and documentation on using Laser Studio.
This documentation can be viewed in the program by going to Help -> Documentation, or it can be viewed online through the project's Github repository.

Laser Studio is an IDE for the expression language used in Tower Unite's laser projectors, designed to provide a smoother experience than the tools built into the game.
It's features include a basic text editor, more complete & accurate documentation, an expression interpreter to run your code in, and a set of basic debugging tools.

Laser Studio is still a work in progress. If you find an inaccuracy while running your expression, or find a bug in the provided tools, please submit a Github issue.
